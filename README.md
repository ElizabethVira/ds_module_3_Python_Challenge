Homework Module 3 - Python
===
Objetive
---
In this exercise you will find the application of different codes to run with python and obtain information that read from a csv file.
During the excercise we used some of the most commun coding for programing like:  
  - Functions
  - Loops
  - Variables
  - Lists
  - Dictionaries

With the aplication of the previus coding, we obtained important data requested to complete the homework, this data include review a csv file to obtain information about a "Profit/Losses" for a company and "Vote counting" process for an small rural town.

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Your analysis should align with the following results:
